                        Eoin O'Sullivan is an artist based in Limerick, Ireland. Initially working in music and sound design, in recent times he has moved towards visual work
                        exploring photography, collage and drawing.

                        Originally from Meath, he moved to Limerick in 2014 to study in University of Limerick and has been based there since. During his studies he investigated
                        creative uses for technology with a particular interest in capturing and reimagining sound. He has produced albums and radio documentaries that
                        respond to communities, sociatal issues and creative practices.
