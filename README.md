# Eoin O'Sullivan Artist Site
This website is designed to provide information on an artist, examples of work and an opportunity to get in touch directly with the artist. The site is targeted towards commisioners and other artists who could potentially be collaborators, with the biography on the homepage giving background to the work that is displayed on the gallery page. There are opportunities for visitors to the site to get in touch with the artist through a contact form and links to other sites where the artist hosts work such as Instagram and Bandcamp.
