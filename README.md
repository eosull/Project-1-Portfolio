# Eoin O'Sullivan Artist Site
This website is designed to provide information on an artist, examples of work and an opportunity to get in touch directly with the artist. The site is targeted towards commisioners and other artists who could potentially be collaborators, with the biography on the homepage giving background to the work that is displayed on the gallery page. There are opportunities for visitors to the site to get in touch with the artist through a contact form and links to other sites where the artist hosts work such as Instagram and Bandcamp.

- Landing Page
  - The landing page is quite minimal with an image and a biography partly overlayed on the image greeting the visitor.
    - An image on the landing page aims to give the visitor an impression of the kind of work they will see in the site.
    - The biography provides information on the artist including where they are based, their field of work, education and internal/external links to examples of work.
    - The bigraphy also points the visitor in the direction of the purpose of the site - visiting the gallery and using the contact form if so inclined.
